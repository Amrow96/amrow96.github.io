Hello my name is Pau GonzÃ¡lez and I am studying the last course of web application design.
00:00:04.500 -->  00:00:09.500
Last year I finished the multiplatform app and I'm going to explain a little bit about how to get around this page.
00:00:09.500 -->  00:00:17.500
Here in the navigation bar you can click on the icon and it returns you to this page.
 00:00:17.500 -->  00:00:23.500
Then you have different sections where you can move through this entire page.
 00:00:23.500 -->  00:00:27.500
And then you have a button that says CV with which you can download my resume.
 00:00:27.500 -->  00:00:36.500
And a configuration section where you can change both the language and the theme of the page to dark mode. 
 00:00:36.500 -->  00:00:41.500
Another curiosity is that if you click on the large logo, this one above will also change.
 00:00:41.500 -->  00:00:47.500
And to end here in the video next to it there are three dots that if you press you can activate the subtitles for this video.
 00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:55.500
I leave you here a couple of options for you to see a couple of micro presentations that I made this year that I think are very interesting.
 00:00:55.500 -->  00:01:00.000
Let's see what you think
